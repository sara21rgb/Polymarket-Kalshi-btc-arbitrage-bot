# Polymarket-Kalshi BTC Arbitrage bot

15-minute BTC market arbitrage bot that detects price differences between **Polymarket** and **Kalshi** and decides **when to buy on Polymarket** based on configurable rules.


## How it works

- **Real-time detection**: Fetches YES/NO token prices from both Polymarket (CLOB) and Kalshi (orderbook + market status) on a configurable interval.
- **Start window**: The bot only evaluates buy signals **after 8 minutes** (configurable) from market start time.
- **Buy rules**:
  1. **Spread rule**: When Kalshi's YES price is in the **93–96¢** range and Polymarket's YES token is **at least 10¢ cheaper** (or equal), the bot signals **buy on Polymarket**.
  2. **Late resolution**: If Kalshi has **finished** (closed/settled) but Polymarket is **still open** and has liquidity, the bot signals **buy on Polymarket** (arbitrage on timing difference).

## Stack

- **Rust** — core engine: market clients, EIP-712 signing, arbitrage signal logic, HTTP API (Axum)
- **TypeScript** — Express layer: config loading, poller orchestration, REST endpoints, Winston logging
- **ethers** (Rust + TS) for Polymarket CLOB order signing
- **dotenv** for configuration

## API

- **GET /health** — Health check.
- **GET /status** — Last Polymarket and Kalshi prices, current arbitrage signal, whether trading is enabled, start window status, total signals and orders placed.
- **POST /poll/start** — Start the price polling loop.
- **POST /poll/stop** — Pause the polling loop.

## Signal format

`/status` response includes a `lastSignal` object:

```json
{
  "kind": "spread_arb",
  "kalshiYesCents": 95,
  "polymarketYesCents": 82,
  "spreadCents": 13,
  "kalshiStatus": "open",
  "startWindowPassed": true,
  "actionable": true,
  "reason": "Kalshi=95¢ in [93–96¢], Polymarket=82¢, spread=13¢ ≥ 10¢",
  "signalAt": "2025-02-19T15:09:42.000Z"
}
```

- `kind: "spread_arb"` — spread rule triggered; includes `kalshiYesCents`, `polymarketYesCents`, `spreadCents`
- `kind: "late_resolution"` — Kalshi finished, Polymarket still open; includes `kalshiStatus`
- `kind: "none"` — no actionable signal; `reason` explains why
